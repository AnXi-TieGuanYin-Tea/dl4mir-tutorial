# dl4mir-tutorial

This walkthrough demonstrates how to "do" deep learning in Python on some music tasks that may be of interest to those in the ISMIR community. To get the most out of this exercise, the reader should already possess a reasonable grasp of basic concepts and terminology; if this isnâ€™t the case, we recommend reviewing any and all information found at the deep learning homepage before proceeding.
That said, this prerequisite knowledge is not strictly necessary to complete the tutorial, and you may still find the exercise worthwhile without it.

Both are password protected to slow the bots, but it's an easy one to remember (`neuralnetsarefun`).
